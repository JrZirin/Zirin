              <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When it comes
        to mobile development, there are two approaches: <strong>native</strong> and <strong>HTML 5</strong>
        (also called cross platform or hybrid development). At Zirin labs, we specialize in HTML 5 mobile app
        development.Both industry leaders and small businesses outsource app development to us.</span></div>

                Let&rsquo;s say you need to develop an app for multiple OS platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone,
                Blackberry, etc.). Which approach should you choose, native or hybrid?</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
                With native development you would have to code different versions of your app for every platform you
                want to launch on. The reason for that is that native development entails development with the programming
                language of the platform, so for iOS you would have to code with Objective C or Swift, for Android it would be Java, and so on.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
                This means that likely you would need to hire different developers for each platform, as it would be hard
                to find one expert programmer who knows all programming languages equally well. The same goes for your budget
                and time, as you would have to spend time and money for each version of your app.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
                Alternatively, you can develop your app with cross-platform technologies. This means that your app will be
                developed with HTML 5 (sometimes also PHP and JavaScript) and then wrapped with hybrid frameworks like Apache
                Cordova (Ionic or PhoneGap), to be recognized by various OS as a native app. In that way one version of your
                app will fit multiple platforms, with only minor adjustments. Due to this, and also because on average HTML 5
                development services cost less than native programming, this alternative approach should take much less time and money.</span></p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
                However, an HTML 5 alternative has some considerable technical constraints as opposed to a native app. You won&rsquo;t
                be able to utilize all of your phone hardware features (<a href="#" rel="nofollow">list of supported features</a>) as well
                as with native and it would be more challenging to get accepted by the App Store. This means that there is no one-size-fits-all
                approach each project is unique and requires a unique solution.</span></p>
