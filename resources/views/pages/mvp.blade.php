                  <p>Weâ€™ve built a variety of our own MVP development solutions,
                 which we can reuse for other projects to speed up the development process.</p>

                  <p>We use HTML 5 technology stack for mobile development, which
                    is often the best option to develop an MVP of a mobile app.</p>

                  <p>In the long run, it is usually more cost-efficient to build
                a product that can be further evolved into a fully featured end product.
                However, this means that we would have to spend some time to build a solid foundation.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-center">Prototype to be thrown away</h3>
                  <p>In some cases, it makes sense to develop an app or a website just for the
                validation phase. In this way, you will be able to launch faster with smaller budget,
                so that later, upon idea validation, you could receive funding for end product development.</p>
