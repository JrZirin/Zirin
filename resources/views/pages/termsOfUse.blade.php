        <p class="western"><strong>ACCEPTANCE</strong></p>
        <p class="western">
            1. Zirin Labs (&ldquo;Zirin Labs.com&rdquo;), is a provider of web hosting, electronic commerce,
             and e-mail solutions and other related services (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). The
              Services are provided through the servers, telecommunication connections and all related hardware,
              software, data storage and network interface connections and other such items, owned, operated or
              leased by Zirin Labs and used in connection with the provision of the Services (the &ldquo;System&rdquo;).
              In these terms and conditions, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo; means Zirin Labs.</p>

        <p class="western">
            2. By accessing the System or using any of the Services, you agree, without limitation or qualification,
            to be bound by these terms and conditions and such other additional or alternative terms, conditions, rules
            and policies which are displayed or to which you may be directed in connection with any particular Service
            or website, as all of the same may be modified by Internet Names for Business from time to time (collectively
            the &ldquo;Terms and Conditions&rdquo;). Please note that the Terms and Conditions may be updated from time to
            time without notice to you, so please check back periodically.</p>

        <p class="western"><strong>DOMAIN NAME PARKING AND REGISTRATION</strong></p>

        <p class="western">
            1. Your credit card will be billed by Zirin Labs Ltd</p>
        <p class="western">
            2. There is no charge for indefinite parking of domains on Zirin Labs servers or to transfer to another service provider.</p>

        <p class="western">
            3. Domain parking does NOT include web space or hosting services. You are not provided with the option to submit your own DNS
            entries as we are NOT a Registrar and therefore assume that you wish to obtain your hosting services directly from Zirin Labs.</p>

        <p class="western">
            4. If you have registered a domain name in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, hosting services will be available 24
            hours after the initialization process begins. This includes DNS Support and web hosting support.</p>
            
        <p class="western">5. Domain name payments are non-refundable. Once a domain name is registered, the WHOIS database stores the information and is kept there for a period of one year, until the date of renewal. Payment will NOT be credited back.</p>
        <p class="western">6. In the event there is a misspelling of a domain name, while being registered online, you as the customer must register the correct spelling of that name. There are NO refunds issued for misspelled domain names.</p>
        <p class="western"><strong>DOMAIN NAME DISPUTES.</strong></p>
        <p class="western">1. You agree to be bound by the dispute policy which is incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement (&ldquo;Dispute Policy&rdquo;). Please take the time to familiarize yourself with this policy.</p>
        <p class="western">2. You represent that, to the best of the your knowledge and belief, neither the registration of the domain name nor the manner in which it is directly or indirectly used infringes the legal rights of a third party and that the domain name is not being registered for any unlawful purpose.</p>
        <p class="western">3. You acknowledge and agree that any third party may, for whatever reason, challenge the use of a domain name before an Administrative Domain Name Challenge Panel (&ldquo;ACP&rdquo;) in accordance with the World Intellectual Property Organization (&ldquo;WIPO&rdquo;) ACP rules. You further acknowledge and agree that the decisions of an ACP may determine your rights or other party&rsquo;s rights with respect to the use of a particular domain name and you agree to be bound by ACP decisions.</p>
        <p class="western">4. You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in effect at the time of the dispute. You agree that in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the Dispute Policy. For any dispute, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of The Province of Ontario.</p>
        <p class="western">5. You agree that your registration of the domain name shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to any ICANN-adopted policy, or pursuant to any registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with an ICANN-adopted policy, (1) to correct mistakes by Registrar or the Registry in registering the name or (2) for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.</p>
        <p class="western">6. Should you intend to license use of a domain name to a third party you shall nonetheless be the domain name holder of record and are therefore responsible for providing your own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name. You shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name, unless you promptly disclose the identity of the licensee to the party providing you reasonable evidence of actionable harm. You also represent that you have provided notice of the Terms and Conditions to the third party and that the third party agrees to them.</p>
        <p class="western">7. The person named as administrative contact at the time the controlling user name and Password are secured shall be the owner of the domain name. You agree that prior to transferring ownership of your domain name to another person (the Transferee&rdquo;) you shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the Terms and Conditions. Your domain name will not be transferred until we receive such written assurances or other reasonable assurance that the Transferee has been bound by the contractual terms of this Agreement (such reasonable assurance as determined by us in our sole discretion) along with the applicable transfer fee. If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us in our sole discretion) to the Terms and Condition, any such transfer will be null and void.</p>
        <p class="western"><strong>ACCESS DATABASES</strong></p>
        <p class="western">Microsoft Access is not designed for, nor recommended for use on busy websites. We can not guarantee performance for websites which make use of Microsoft Access databases. We recommend using MySQL or MS-SQL for increased performance and reliability.</p>

        <p class="western">2. EasyMail E-Mail Accounts are restricted to a maximum e-mail transfer of 20MB per Mail Server request. This is restricted by the Mail Server.</p>

You also agree to release, indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the Dispute Policy. When we are threatened with suit by a third party, we may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to indemnify us; your failure to provide those assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of the Terms and Conditions and may result in deactivation of your domain name.</p>
